    "about": "Building on the raised intensity of his recent release on the Dutch label New York Haunted, Modus Operandi opens the door to a new phase of Jeremy Dickens' work under that banner. Drawing together threads of the more atmospheric strains of '80s & '90s industrial, the early output of Warp Records, and the intensity of modern Berlin techno, Modus Operandi focuses these influences and weaves them into a tapestry that is comfortable both in the listening room and on the dance floor. The melodic and atmospheric elements that run consistently through Logickal's work are present and familiar but framed with a darker and more aggressive sensibility. \r\n\r\nWith tracks carefully stitched together as two continuous sides, the music journeys through the darker corners of today's world like a fever dream of the surveillance state, a mood helped by the inclusion of voices culled from wartime propaganda and training material. Some more ambient moments provide pivot points along the way to help the album coalesce into a cinematic accompaniment to today's uncertain times."

These three tracks are distillations of some of these sketches, suitable for gazing out the window and watching the world turn green while sheltering in place."
