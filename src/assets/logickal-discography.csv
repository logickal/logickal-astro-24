Dedicated to The Venerable Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche and the memory and legacy of The Venerable Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche
https://www.padmasambhava.org","A brief audio ritual to Vajrakilaya to dispel obstructions and obstacles in your path.


All existing phenomena arise as the mudra of the blazing Heruka. 
Unceasing sounds and echoes are transformed into the music of Kilaya.
Recognition of one’s own awareness is the absolute wisdom Kilaya.
May everyone actualize this state, having spontaneously accomplished all the buddha activities.

May the secret treasures of all the victorious ones, Their incomparably supreme teachings,
Arise as the sun in the sky,
Gloriously pervading the entire universe.
By this merit, may all attain omniscience,
May it defeat the enemy, wrongdoing.
From the stormy waves of birth, old age, sickness, and death, From the ocean of samsara, may we free all beings."

May you who bind the entire network Of the supreme skillful means,
Which appears as great bliss,
In the seal of discriminative awareness, Which is emptiness in its natural state, Heruka, completely present
In mobile and motionless creatures, All-pervading lord and guru,
Grant protection until enlightenment.

Dickens,"Building on the raised intensity of his recent release on the Dutch label New York Haunted, Modus Operandi opens the door to a new phase of Jeremy Dickens' work under that banner. Drawing together threads of the more atmospheric strains of '80s & '90s industrial, the early output of Warp Records, and the intensity of modern Berlin techno, Modus Operandi focuses these influences and weaves them into a tapestry that is comfortable both in the listening room and on the dance floor. The melodic and atmospheric elements that run consistently through Logickal's work are present and familiar but framed with a darker and more aggressive sensibility. 

With tracks carefully stitched together as two continuous sides, the music journeys through the darker corners of today's world like a fever dream of the surveillance state, a mood helped by the inclusion of voices culled from wartime propaganda and training material. Some more ambient moments provide pivot points along the way to help the album coalesce into a cinematic accompaniment to today's uncertain times."

by J. Dickens","I recently picked up a Digitone, a little desktop FM synthesizer made by Elektron. Because of its size, I'm able to keep front and center of the studio all day, where I gradually build up sequences over the course of the day, giving me an interesting soundtrack for whatever else I'm doing. These three tracks are distillations of some of these sketches, suitable for gazing out the window and watching the world turn green while sheltering in place."
