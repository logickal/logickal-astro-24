description: 'A brief bio of Jeremy Dickens, also known as Logickal'
---

The primary endeavor of Nashville-based producer, engineer and musician Jeremy Dickens, Logickal is the product of Dickensâ€™ over 30 years of sonic explorations in the Wyrd South, weaving esoteric electronics into the tapestry of Music City.
            
In its current incarnation, he melds the direct and assertive rhythms of industrial and Berlin-style techno with the abstract unfolding esotericism of classic ambient and drone music. Central to his process is the union of improvisation and meditative techniques alongside  an emphasis on modular synthesis and other hardware-based production methods.
            
He has had his sound design work released by such companies as M-Audio and Sony, and collaborated with artists as diverse as George Clinton and Stephen Mallinder via his involvement with the techno-anarchist collective 3kStatic.
            
He continues to release music exploring themes ranging from life in the modern surveillance state, to explorations of post-modern esoteric tradition, all told by way of orbital mechanics.
